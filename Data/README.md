# ðŸ“Š Extracted Model Parameters and Laterality Indices

This repository contains a summary DataFrame of subject-specific parameters and laterality indices extracted from personalized whole-brain neurophysiological models fit using the [WBMLangBetaERDS](https://github.com/Minarose/WBMLangBetaERDS) pipeline.

## Why Only Parameters?

Due to file size limitations, the full fitted models (2 conditions Ã— 43 subjects) are not included in this repository. Instead, we provide the key parameters extracted from each subjectâ€™s fitted model, alongside empirical and simulated Laterality Indices (LI) and subject age. These features are sufficient to reproduce all group-level and subject-level analyses shown in the manuscript.

## What's Included?

The main file in this repository is:
- `subject_data.pkl`: a dataframe where each row corresponds to one subject. Including 39 subjects after exluding subjects with LI = 0

This dataframe contains:
- Fitted model parameters (local, long-range, etc.)
- Empirical and simulated laterality indices (`t_LI_emp`, `t_LI_sim`)
- Subject age

All scripts to reproduce the figures and statistical analyses in the manuscript can be found in the [`Analysis`](https://github.com/Minarose/WBMLangBetaERDS/tree/main/Analysis) directory of the main repository. This extracted data can be used as input to those scripts.
