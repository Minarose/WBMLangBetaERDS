## **📖 Overview**  
This repository contains the complete code for the study:  

> **"Development of Inhibitory Circuits Drives Language Lateralization in Childhood"**  
> *Ismail et al., [Journal Name, Year]*  

In this study, we explore the **mechanisms underlying language lateralization** in childhood using **personalized whole-brain network models**. Our findings reveal that interhemispheric inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in shaping lateralized language function, with local inhibition decreasing over development while interhemispheric inhibition increases.  

Using **systematic model manipulations** and **virtual transplant experiments**, we show that the reduction in local inhibition allows pre-existing asymmetries in interhemispheric inhibition to drive laterality. This work provides a **developmental framework** for understanding how inhibitory circuits shape language networks.

## **🧠 Methods Summary**  
Our study employs **personalized whole-brain network models** based on individual structural connectivity and MEG-derived functional activity. The key computational model parameters include:  

- **Local Inhibition (I-P coupling):** Decreases with age but does not directly predict laterality.  
- **Interhemispheric Inhibition (P-I coupling):** Increases with age and correlates with laterality.  
- **Model Manipulations:** Virtual lesion and transplant experiments to assess causality in lateralization.
