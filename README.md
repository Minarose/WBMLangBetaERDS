In this study, we explore the **mechanisms underlying language lateralization** in childhood using **personalized whole-brain network models**. Our findings reveal that interhemispheric inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in shaping lateralized language function, with local inhibition decreasing over development while interhemispheric inhibition increases.  

Using **systematic model manipulations** and **virtual transplant experiments**, we show that the reduction in local inhibition allows pre-existing asymmetries in interhemispheric inhibition to drive laterality. This work provides a **developmental framework** for understanding how inhibitory circuits shape language networks.
