Hemispheric specialization is a hallmark of brain organization across species, yet the mechanisms that drive the formation of functionally specialized circuits remain poorly understood. In humans, the gradual emergence of left-hemisphere dominance for language over the first two decades offers a well-characterized model for probing these mechanisms. Here, we constructed personalized whole-brain neurophysiological models in children and adolescents, to simulate task-evoked dynamics from auditory perception to language production. These models were grounded in individual structural connectivity from diffusion MRI and fit to magnetoencephalography data using machine learning optimization.  We demonstrate that hemispheric specialization emerges through distinct inhibitory processes during development.   

Early in life, asymmetries in interhemispheric inhibition are present, with stronger projections from left pyramidal cells to right inhibitory interneurons. However, these asymmetries alone are insufficient to drive functional specialization. Using \textit{in silico} manipulations, including virtual circuit transplants, we show that progressive developmental reduction in local inhibition is necessary to unmask the functional influence of early asymmetries. Local disinhibition enables structural asymmetries to shape functional lateralization. Our findings reveal a mechanistic model in which functional specialization arises from the interaction between early structural asymmetries and developmental disinhibition, a process that can be generalized across species and cognitive domains using our computational framework.
